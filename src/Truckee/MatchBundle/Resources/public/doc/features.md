##Truckee/Volunteer Project Features

###Unregistered visitors

Visitors may search for non-profit opportunities.  Search results can be filtered by non-profit organization name, organization focus, opportunity skill in any combination.  When focus or skill criteria are used search results are sorted by percent of criteria used to select an opportunity.   

If appropriate, a visitor can register as either a volunteer or as a non-profit organization staff member.

###Registered Volunteers

Volunteer registrations are effective as soon as the e-mail address is confirmed. Once registered, volunteers will receive e-mail notification of newly posted opportunities that match their focus and skill profile. Volunteers can change their profile at any time and stop or restart e-mail notifications.

When signed in, volunteer focus and skill criteria used as defaults for opportunity searches.

###Registered Organizations

Additional staff members may be registered by contacting the site administrator. [It is not possible to register the same organization more than once.] Staff members can:

*   Change their personal profile.
